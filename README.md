## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whois-lookup-app.git
cd whois-lookup-app
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

```bash
cd backend
```

#### Set API Key

Before running, set your WhoisXML API key as an environment variable:
```Open the file:
- backend/src/main/java/com/example/service/WhoisLookupService.java
```

```Locate the following line near the top:
- private static final String API_KEY = "at_p9oMvlyBm5T9xfClFR2M9e4uQq48b";
```

```Replace the value with your own API key from WhoisXML API:

- private static final String API_KEY = "YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE";
```

#### Build and Run Backend

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
(Or `mvn spring-boot:run` if Maven is installed globally)

The backend should start on: `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend runs at: `http://localhost:3000`

Make sure the backend is running for the API calls to work.
